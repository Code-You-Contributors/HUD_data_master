# Louisville Metro Government Salary Study

## purpose 

We aimed to analyze Louisville Metro Government salary data to identify opportunities for better allocating resources to support the city’s homeless population. Our approach focused on examining employees who worked more than 52 hours per week, resulting in significant overtime costs. We found that the departments with the highest levels of overtime were predominantly those responsible for services that interact with or directly support the homeless community.
